The Simon game is a classic electronic memory game that tests a player's ability to remember and reproduce sequences of colored lights and sounds. The game consists of a round device with four colored buttons, each associated with a unique tone. The game randomly generates a sequence of button presses, and the player must replicate the sequence by pressing the buttons in the correct order. As the game progresses, the sequences become longer and more challenging. The goal is to see how long the player can accurately recall and repeat the growing patterns. The game's simplicity and focus on memory make it a popular choice for both children and adults.
